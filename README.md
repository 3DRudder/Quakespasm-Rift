## Quake Rift Aim Mod

[Download Here](https://github.com/swax/Quakespasm-Rift/releases)

This is a mod to the rift quakespasm mod by [@phoboslab](https://github.com/phoboslab) that I think works well for fast paced fps gaming.

A laser sight is added because that's the 3d equivalent of a crosshair in 2d.

Aiming is done only with the mouse just like in 2d.

Also like 2d, you don't need to move your head much except for better situational awareness. The rift is especially useful for sniping because you can keep your aim on a target and look over to see if anyone is coming. 

Use ~ to access the console and type 'r_oculusrift 1' to activate the rift view. 

Enjoy,

PS Valve - Please make this 'vr_moveaim_mode 9' in tf2 :smile:
